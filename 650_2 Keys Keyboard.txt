nitially on a notepad only one character 'A' is present. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:

Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the notepad (partial copy is not allowed).
Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.
Given a number n. You have to get exactly n 'A' on the notepad by performing the minimum number of steps permitted. Output the minimum number of steps to get n 'A'.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
		int num = n;
		int[] dp = new int[num+1];
		
		for(int i = 1; i <= num; i++){
			dp[i] = 2000;
		}
		dp[1] = 0;
		for(int i = 2; i <= num; i++){
			for(int j = 1; j <= i ; j++){
				if(i % j == 0){
					dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + i/j);
				}
			}
		}
		return dp[num];
    }
}
